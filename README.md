# c-raycaster
This project made use of a 'game engine' header file I had written using Win32 GDI for basic software rendering.
Inspired by [OneLoneCoder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA), I made my own single-header game engine file and my own take on a raycaster.
The most novel thing about my raycaster was the dynamic lighting and relatively high resolution capabilities running in software with no major effort on optimization.
I also wrote several helper tools along the way to help me understand some of the maths and to easily visualize if my approaches were working as I expected.

Everything in here is the code leading up to my first succesful go at having dynamic lighting.
I had started a rewrite, but that is not included yet in this repo, and had very little progress made before work became my primary focus.
